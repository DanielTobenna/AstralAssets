                     <h3>Part 3: Crypto Asset Wallets</h3>
                     <br><br>
                     1. General. Crypto asset wallets are provided by third party custodians which are not owned or
                     controlled by AstralAssets. Through these third party custodian wallets, we enable you to
                     monitor the storage, tracking and management of Digital assets contained in a hosted digital
                     currency wallet. You will have the ability to request, send and receive (by placing orders), and
                     store Digital assets from third parties by giving instructions through the Site. We may limit this
                     functionality, and we may require you to verify your identity prior to engaging in certain
                     transactions<br><br>
                     <h3>Part 4: Transactions</h3>
                     1. Digital Asset Transactions. We process transactions according to the instructions you submit
                     to us. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or another party; therefore, you
                     should verify that all information is correct prior to sending instructions to us. If you submit an
                     order, that order will be irrevocable and final unless that order is cancelled prior to execution.
                     Any pending withdrawals from your AstralAssets Account that have been submitted to a Digital
                     Asset network will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the
                     transaction by the Digital Asset network. Transactions in a pending state may not be available
                     for AstralAssets to reverse or otherwise alter the transaction. The funds used for your pending
                     transactions will not be displayed in your account balance or be available to conduct other
                     transactions.<br><br>
                     2. Operation of Digital Asset Protocols. AstralAssets does not own or control the underlying
                     software protocols that govern the operation of Digital assets supported on our platform. In
                     general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and
                     distribute them. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible
                     for operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality,
                     security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in
                     operating rules (a/k/a “forks”) that could materially affect the value, function, name, and other
                     attributes of the Digital Asset. In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend
                     operations (with or without advance support to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide
                     whether or not to support either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and
                     agree that AstralAssets has no responsibility whatsoever for a branch of a forked protocol that is
                     unsupported.<br><br>
                     <h3>Part 5: Staking</h3>
                     1. Staking Services. When you hold Digital assets in your AstralAssets Account, you may be able
                     to “stake” these assets in a third-party proof-of-stake network via staking services facilitated
                     by AstralAssets. In a proof-of-stake network, transaction validators are chosen using a formula
                     based on ownership of the underlying Digital Asset as opposed to computing power (i.e.,
                     proof of work). Our custodian partners will stake these assets on your behalf. In addition,
                     AstralAssets entities or its service providers may serve as transaction validators or similar
                     nodes on their own behalf on the networks where these assets are staked. In this capacity,
                     neither AstralAssets nor its affiliated entities uses your Digital assets.
                     2. Automatic Voting Proxy. If you stake your assets with us, you agree to give us, the protocol,
                     our custodian or node operation partners your proxy to vote on any governance issues
                     relating to the staked Digital Asset, and you waive any right to any claim related to any such
                     voting right. Further, unless we or our custodian partner determines that it is in the best
                     interests of such custodian partner, AstralAssets, or you to vote on such governance matters,
                     the custodian or node operation partner shall abstain from participating in any such vote.
                     3. No Guarantee. You have no right to a reward until it is received by the designated protocol or
                     our custodian partner and processed by AstralAssets and until you have maintained a positive
                     balance for at least three (3) consecutive days during the applicable period. Your reward will
                     be distributed on a pro-rata basis based on your average balance of the particular Digital
                     Asset to the total of all rewards received by our custodian partner and processed by
                     AstralAssets during the applicable period. Rewards will be distributed to your AstralAssets
                     Account once per month unless otherwise provided. AstralAssets will use reasonable efforts to
                     facilitate the staking of any Digital assets for which you are using AstralAssets’s staking
                     services. The “staking rewards rate” is disclosed by AstralAssets for each particular Digital
                     Asset. For any Digital Asset listed for less than 90 days, AstralAssets shall use commercially
                     reasonable efforts to determine a reward rate that it determines is reasonably likely to be
                     achieved for the following month. This rate is an estimate and changes over time.
                     AstralAssets DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY STAKING REWARDS,
                     ANY SPECIFIC STAKING REWARD, OR ANY STAKING RETURN OVER TIME, INCLUDING
                     THE STAKING REWARDS RATE. ALL SUCH REWARDS ARE BASED ENTIRELY ON THE
                     UNDERLYING PROTOCOL OF THE APPLICABLE DIGITAL ASSET.
                     4. AstralAssets reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to cease providing staking
                     services, including discontinuing the accrual of any rewards, in the event that AstralAssets
                     suspects any fraud, misconduct, potential compromise of the underlying protocol or any other
                     Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business.<br><br>

                     <h3>APPENDIX 4: STATE LICENSE DISCLOSURES</h3>
                     AstralAssets ( “AstralAssets”) maintains licenses to engage in money transmission activities in many
                     states, and these licenses may impact our provision and your use of certain AstralAssets Markets
                     Services depending on where you live. AstralAssets Markets' licenses and corresponding required
                     disclosures can be found on the AstralAssets Licenses Disclosure page
                     Please note the following disclosures associated with virtual currency:<br>
                     ● Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value
                     balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor
                     Protection Corporation protections.<br>
                     ● Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may
                     adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currency.<br>
                     ● Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
                     accidental transactions may not be recoverable.<br>
                     ● Some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public
                     ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction.<br>
                     ● The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market
                     participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for
                     permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual
                     currency disappear.<br>
                     ● There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as payment today will
                     continue to do so in the future.<br>
                     ● The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat currency may
                     result in significant loss over a short period of time.<br>
                     ● The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.<br>
                     ● The nature of virtual currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by
                     AstralAssets may prevent the access or use of a customer's virtual currency.<br>
                     ● Any bond or trust account maintained by AstralAssets t for the benefit of its customers may not
                     be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.<br>
                     ● Withdrawal can be stopped
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     POTENTIAL USERS OF DIGITAL OR VIRTUAL CURRENCIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
                     BITCOIN, SHOULD BE FOREWARNED OF A POSSIBLE FINANCIAL LOSS AT THE TIME THAT
                     SUCH CURRENCIES ARE EXCHANGED FOR FIAT CURRENCY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE
                     EXCHANGE RATE. A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE AT THE TIME OF EXCHANGE CAN RESULT
                     IN A TAX LIABILITY. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING ANY TAX
                     CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR HOLDING OR USE OF DIGITAL OR VIRTUAL
